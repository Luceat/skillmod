# skillmod
A Skill Modification for Wurm Unlimited

This mod is to be used with Agos modloader which can be found at https://github.com/ago1024/WurmServerModLauncher

To use it, download a relase and extract it to the folder "mods" in your WU dedicated server directory.

To configure the mod, open the skillmod.properties file in the folder "mods".

The mod allows you to change the difficulty of any skill individually in WU, thereby improving your skill gain.

Additionally, the mod can remove the priest penalty to five of the characteristics. I am unsure if they are actually used, but they were simple to remove.
